# Python-Projects
Beginner python projects
All of the files found in this repository are beginner level projects I used to reintroduce myself to python. 
In 2020 I took a college course for python but was unable to complete the course due to the pandemic.
I started working in IT and haven't been able to get back into programming/scripting until very recently.
These few projects were used to remember the basics while also having a it of fun functionality.
