Hello Everyone!

My name is Tyrrell and this repository is where I store all of my reintroductionary python projects!

All of the files found in this repository are beginner level projects I used to reintroduce myself to python. 
In 2020 I took a college course for python but was unable to complete the course due to the pandemic.
I started working full time and haven't been able to get back into programming/scripting until very recently. (April 2022)
These few projects were used to remember the basics while also having a it of fun functionality.
